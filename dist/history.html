            Lester Shepard Parker
          </h1>

          <p>
            Lester Shepard Parker (1860-1925) Massachusetts, Kentucky, Illinois,
            Maryland, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Michigan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following information is provided by Fred W. McCraw, art writer
            from Kansas City.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lester Shepard Parker was born in 1860 in Worcester, Massachusetts.
            When he was age three, his family moved to Lexington, Kentucky for
            five years and from there to Chicago in 1868. His father, George C.
            Parker, worked there in a shoe manufacturing company (Phelps, Dodge
            and Palmer). By 1871 the Parkers were living next door to a Mrs.
            O’Leary—she of cow-keeping fame. From being her nearest downwind
            neighbor, the Parker family was the first among scores of families
            to see their home burned to the ground in the great Chicago fire of
            that year.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the fire, all or part of the family appear to have relocated
            to Worcester to regroup. Lester, at least, was there attending
            Worcester Academy in his mid-teen years before going on to graduate
            in 1879 “with a background in Law” from Baltimore City College (a
            then combination Prep School and Junior College) in Maryland. At age
            19, he then followed the dictum popularized by Horace Greeley and
            headed west to what in his birth year had been “Kansas Territory.”
            He settled in the mid-state Salina area where he married, had two
            children and for fifteen years prospered as a lawyer, teacher, and
            rancher raising sheep and cattle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lester excelled in law, painting, poetry, music composition and
            business—as much or more a Renaissance man as any other of his North
            American contemporaries. He was best known as a turn-of-the-century
            lawyer/industrialist and a close adviser to several Missouri
            governors. But he also was a well-known writer of history and
            poetry, a composer of ragtime and other popular music and an
            accomplished artist by avocation working skillfully and quite
            professionally over many years in both oils and watercolors, and
            with diverse subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1894, after 15 years in Kansas, Lester moved for one year to St.
            Paul, Minnesota. He had arranged to work there as a foreman in a
            shoe manufacturing company—presumably as an apprenticeship for
            founding one such company of his own in Jefferson City, Missouri,
            which he did soon after leaving Minnesota. He did live briefly in
            Chicago to arrange financing before settling permanently in
            Jefferson City where he founded L.S. Parker Shoe Company. In later
            years he often summered in South Haven, Michigan where he owned a
            resort. He also had mining and cotton interests in southwest and
            southeast Missouri respectively, and owned, among other business
            interests, a telephone company. Possibly it was in his Kansas or
            mid-Jefferson City years that he managed to study art in Paris at
            the Acadamie Colarossi. He was there, but the years of his training
            are, so far, elusive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some elements of French Impressionist techniques are in his work.
            One of his most notable achievements came when the Missouri Capitol
            building burned and was replaced in the 1911-22 period. Mr. Parker
            is credited with being the person most responsible for filling the
            new Capitol Building with mural masterworks by celebrated and/or
            promising early 20th century American artists, including one or more
            of the famed “Taos 10” or “Taos Founders.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In a brief to the National Park Service, Jane Rodes Beetem wrote:
            “After the Capitol was destroyed by fire in 1911, a massive
            rebuilding effort was launched. To supervise decoration of the new
            Capitol in 1917, Governor Gardner appointed a five member Capitol
            Decoration Commission. In 1922, an advisory committee was formed to
            work with the Capitol Decoration Commission. The advisers included
            Governor A.M. Hyde, Lieutenant Governor Hiram Lloyd, Senator William
            Irwin, Lester S. Parker, and Hugh Stephens, for many years publisher
            of the Jefferson City Tribune. Parker was included on the committee
            due to his interest in and appreciation of the arts, his interest in
            the Capitol, and his reputation as a local artist.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In his 1925 eulogy to Lester Parker, his friend and publisher, Hugh
            Stephens, remarked: “To him is due the credit for having rescued
            from defeat the movement to decorate the state capitol when that
            work had just started and was about to be given up. Single-handed he
            began a thorough study of the great purpose and aim of its
            decorations, and as a result we have in this city a building on
            which there has been expended for art nearly a million dollars,
            making it perhaps the greatest public building in that respect,
            within the bounds of the United States, except the Library of
            Congress. He was the first to deliver lectures on the subject here
            and elsewhere. He wrote a book describing the works of art, which
            book he published at his own expense. This community will never
            cease to draw dividends from the thousands of visitors who will come
            here as a result of the interest which he created.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lester Parker was long a lay leader in the Baptist Church near his
            home, where he counseled and assisted in its work and growth. He
            died from a post-operative blood-clot on July 25, 1925 following
            surgery at the Mayo Clinic hospital in Rochester, Minnesota.

            Writer's Note: A significant source for the above biographical
            sketch has been Section 8 (Pages 14-19) from a National Register of
            Historic Places document filed with the National Park Service (NPS).
            This United States Department of the Interior Registration Form
            10-900 was signed and filed April 11, 2000. That form was prepared
            as an application for “The Parker, Lester S. and Missouri "Zue"
            Gordon House, Cole County. Missouri” to be designated a “National
            Historic Place.” It was written by Jane Rodes Beetem and her Editor,
            Roger Maserang. It is officially titled: NPS Registration Form
            10-900-a (8-86).
          </p>
          <p>
            The lengthy biography of Lester Parker in that document was included
            to provide additional non-architectural reasons for preserving his
            Jefferson City mansion, since Mt. Parker was demonstrably very
            important in Missouri's early history. Below is that full biography
          </p>
          <p>
            (Criterion B - Association with Life of a Significant Person: ) It
            was through shoe manufacturing that Lester Shepard Parker earned the
            wealth that enabled his fine residence to be constructed. Parker's
            father had worked for a shoe manufacturer in Chicago when Lester was
            young. Unfortunately for the Parkers, according to a biographical
            sketch in The Illustrated Sketch Book and Directory of Jefferson
            City and Cole County,1900, they lived next door to Mrs. O'Leary and
            her illustrious cow, and their house was the first one consumed by
            the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.
          </p>
          <p>
            “After graduation from college in 1879” Parker moved to Kansas where
            he practiced law, taught school and farmed, raising sheep and
            cattle. In 1894 he moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, becoming foreman of
            the Kellogg & Johnson shoe factory. One year later in Chicago he
            became associated with C. M. Henderson & Co., organizing the
            Jefferson Shoe Company for the manufacture of shoes in Jefferson
            City, Missouri.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parker moved to Jefferson City in 1895, where he was superintendent
            and general manager of the Jefferson Shoe Company. Just before
            Henderson's death in 1895, Parker disposed of his interest in that
            firm and organized the L. S. Parker Shoe Co., which brought him to
            the forefront of local shoe manufacturing. The incentive for
            manufacturers such as Parker to relocate in Jefferson City was the
            potential profits from using the Missouri State Penitentiary
            buildings, grounds, and inmates. A combination of cheap labor, low
            taxes and rental rates, and competitive freight rates added up to an
            attractive package and a highly successful operation. From the
            state's perspective, this use of the penitentiary was primarily a
            means of making it a more self-supporting institution.
          </p>
          <p>
            A look at previous attempts to utilize inmates as a cheap labor
            source will help explain how the new system came about. The State of
            Missouri had since 1839 been concerned with the cost of maintaining
            the penitentiary. Between 1839 and 1853, various attempts were made
            to lease the penitentiary and absolve the state from all costs of
            its operation. The lessee would, in exchange for use of the prison
            grounds, buildings and inmates, be responsible for all prison
            operations, including food, clothing and shelter for the inmates. In
            the early years, the lessees frequently worked inmates outside the
            prison walls, advertising that prison labor was available for such
            things as construction projects, landscaping and groundskeeping,
            blacksmithing, and house and sign painting. Lax supervision,
            however, led to frequent escapes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Townspeople were distressed not only by the number of prisoners
            working among them and fleeing through town, but that inmates
            working for such low wages were taking jobs from local workers.
            Gross abuses of prison labor and supplies after 1853, while under
            state management, prompted a return to the lease system from 1873 to
            1875. By the late 1870s, Missouri was prepared to try a different
            approach to making the penitentiary self-supporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Governor John S. Phelps' 1879 address to the General Assembly
            recounted the problems and failures of the lease system, and
            remarked on attempts to operate the prison as a manufacturing
            facility run by the prison warden. The governor's recommendation was
            a middle approach in which the facility would not be leased, but
            neither would prison officers serve as business managers for
            manufacturing. Instead, expansion of private industry within the
            prison was favored and the governor's recommendation was carried
            out. Under this arrangement, the state constructed factory buildings
            and then negotiated with manufacturers for multi-year contracts
            specifying terms for the use of prison labor.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1873, shoe manufacturer George Corning testified to the new
            system's success. His operation employed 70 inmates at a cost of 40
            cents each per day, he said, from which he generated an annual
            profit of $5,000. He said the prospects of earning such a
            substantial profit were what convinced him to relocate from St.
            Louis to Jefferson City.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1898 Sanbom Map indicates that the following private
            manufacturers were operating within the prison walls at that time:
            Jacob Strauss Saddlery Co., J. S. Sullivan Saddletree Factory and
            Lumber Yards, Hoskins- Ross Manufacturing (broom factory), Giesecke
            Boot & Shoe Manufacturing Co., A. Priesmeyer Shoe Company, Vaughn
            Monning Shoe Cutters, and L S. Parker Shoe Co. The L. S. Parker Shoe
            Co. is shown on the 1898 map in a large building.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1900, the L. S. Parker Shoe Co. employed 230 people, and had a
            backlog of orders for 65,000 pairs of shoes; by 1904, four shoe
            manufacturers remained in operation at the prison: Bruns
            Manufacturing Company, Giesecke-D'Oench-Hays Shoe Company, L. S.
            Parker Shoe Company, and A. Priesmeyer Shoe Company. (15)
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1908 the L. S. Parker Shoe Co. had expanded, using the same
            building as in 1898 plus the building formerly used by the Jefferson
            Shoe Company and a nearby former warehouse. The practice of
            contracting for prison labor was discontinued in 1915, apparently
            because wages had become more reasonable (higher) and an inmate's
            work day could no longer exceed eight hours; by 1913, the warden was
            authorized to contract for the labor of able-bodied male prisoners
            at a rate of not less than 75-cents per day per prisoner, nearly
            double the rate that George Corning and other early manufacturers
            paid. Even without cheap prison labor, however, shoe manufacturing
            remained an important factor in the Jefferson City economy. In 1936
            it was reported that 1,131 people representing 24 per cent of the
            total labor force was employed in the manufacture of leather goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next available Sanborn Map, in 1923, was made after the state
            took over the prison industries in 1915, but the former L. S. Parker
            Shoe Co. buildings remained in place. By 1939, the building
            initially occupied by the L. S. Parker Shoe Co. and the warehouse
            the company occupied near the upper yard had been removed. The
            remaining building used by the L. S. Parker Shoe Co. was burned
            during the prison riot of 1954. This building was rebuilt using the
            original foundation and walls. Used for a time to house prisoners
            and known as "M" Hall, this building now serves as a prison
            maintenance facility. The Department of Corrections identifies this
            building as having been built in 1956, the date of reconstruction.
            This is the only extant Parker-associated building on the prison
            grounds but since it burned and was rebuilt, it lacks integrity and
            the connection with Parker is not significant.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was while Lester Parker lived in the house at 624 E. Capitol
            Avenue that many, if not most, of his contributions to the community
            were made. By 1913, some 18 years after its establishment in 1895,
            Parker apparently had sold his shoe company and "retired." The 1913
            city directory lists an H. M. Chandler as president of the L. S.
            Parker Shoe Co., and in 1915 an F. M. Chandler is listed as
            president of the company. Parker got out of the business just two
            years before the state terminated the practice of contract labor and
            assumed control of managing the facilities, in 1915. Once the state
            took control of the industries operating on the prison grounds, a
            capable administrator was needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Governor Frederick D. Gardner appointed Parker as the first
            superintendent of industries at the penitentiary in 1915. This post
            was considered sufficiently important that it paid an annual salary
            of $5,000, $2,000 a year more than other state officers and the same
            salary as the governor. For comparison purposes, in 1917 a prison
            guard earned $1,200 per year. Among other things, the superintendent
            was responsible for the overall operation of the prison factories.
            Responsibilities included the purchase of materials for
            manufacturing and the distribution of manufactured goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            During Parker's term as superintendent of industries, a new statute
            authorized payments to prisoners doing acceptable work equaling five
            per cent of their daily earnings, or five per cent of what they
            would have earned if working under contract to private business.
          </p>
          <p>
            During Parker's tenure as superintendent, more than 1,500 prisoners
            were engaged in the manufacture of various goods. At the beginning
            of October 1919, the institution reported a cash balance of $61,000.
            In the same month, Parker announced that "having established the
            prison industries on a footing where they are a profit to the
            State," he wished to retire. According to Parker's friend Hugh
            Stephens: “His master stroke was the organization of the intricate
            system of industries within the state prison. Here he turned a
            liability into an asset and performed a great service to his state.”
            Ex-Gov. Gardner recently stated in a public address that Lester
            Parker contributed more to the success of his administration than
            any other man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to 1900, leasing of the penitentiary and the inmates in order
            to make the prison more self-sustaining were less than successful,
            for various reasons. Under Lester Parker's leadership, however, it
            appears that this goal was finally achieved. The system of prison
            industries over which Parker originally presided continues to
            operate to this day, making all of the license plates and renewal
            stickers for Missouri automobiles, furniture, uniforms, and other
            staples for purchase by state agencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Parker's contribution as first superintendent of the state
            prison industries established a path that has been followed for
            almost 80 years. The house at 624 E. Capitol Avenue, where Parker
            lived from 1905 to 1925, is the largest and most tangible reminder
            of his contributions. As no other intact buildings exist which have
            a strong connection to Parker, this building is eligible for listing
            in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion B.

            Additional Information on Lester S. Parker: Parker served in other
            capacities, to the benefit of both Jefferson City and Missouri.
            Residents of the community and visitors to the Capitol probably
            would have difficulty imagining it today without the extensive
            artwork for which it is so well known. But without Lester Parker's
            contribution, the artwork undoubtedly would have been different and
            perhaps there would have been less of it to appreciate.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the Capitol was destroyed by fire in 1911, a massive
            rebuilding effort was launched. To supervise decoration of the new
            Capitol in 1917, Governor Gardner appointed a five member Capitol
            Decoration Commission. In 1922, an advisory committee was formed to
            work with the Capitol Decoration Commission. The advisers included
            Governor A. M. Hyde, Lieutenant-Governor Hiram Lloyd, Senator
            William Irwin, Hugh Stephens and Lester S. Parker. Parker was
            included on the committee due to his interest in and appreciation of
            the arts, his interest in the Capitol, and his reputation as a local
            artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            A report prepared by John Picard, Ph.D., D.F.A., President of the
            Capitol Decoration Commission in 1928 characterized Parker's service
            to the Commission and State as "invaluable." Advisor Hugh Stephens
            was particularly complimentary. In a eulogy to Parker, Stephens
            stated: “To him is due the credit for having rescued from defeat the
            movement to decorate the state capitol when that work had just
            started and was about to be given up. Single-handed he began a
            thorough study of the great purpose and aim of its decorations, and
            as a result we have in this city a building on which there has been
            expended for art nearly a million dollars, making it perhaps the
            greatest public building in that respect, within the bounds of the
            United States, except the Library of Congress. He was the first to
            deliver lectures on the subject here and elsewhere. He wrote a book
            describing the works of art, which book he published at his own
            expense. This community will never cease to draw dividends from the
            thousands of visitors who will come here as a result of the interest
            which he created.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1924, a year before his death, Parker had published a book
            describing the building's artwork: State Capitol of Missouri, with a
            description of its construction, museum, art features, mural
            paintings, sculptures, art windows and decorations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon Parker's death, one headline was "WELL KNOWN CITIZEN WAS
            RECOVERING FROM OPERATION AT MAYO BROS.; Death Was Due To Blood Clot
            On Heart - End Came Peacefully and Unexpectedly; WIDELY KNOWN CRITIC
            AND ART AUTHORITY; Remains Will Arrive In Jefferson City At 3
            o'clock Monday Morning." The accompanying article describes Parker's
            connection with the Capitol: "In his connection with the Capitol
            Decorating Commission Mr. Parker became known to a large number of
            Missourians who were privileged to listen to his explanation of the
            paintings and decoration in the State Capitol. While Lester Parker
            was long remembered for his role in decoration of the Capitol, his
            residence remains the building most connected with his life.
          </p>
          <p>
            An avocational artist, Parker enjoyed painting scenes from his
            travels abroad in both oils and watercolors. He gave 100 pieces of
            his art collection to the First Baptist Church and one of his
            personal works remains on display there today. Parker's son, Lester
            S. Parker Jr., recently donated two of his father's works to the
            Cole County Historical Society, where they may be viewed in the
            museum and in the society's office. Several of Parker's works are
            also displayed in local homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parker also wrote and published poems and songs, such as Come Back
            My Honey to Missouri, touted by some as a possible candidate for
            state song. He published a book of poems, titled Nancy Macintyre, a
            tale of the prairies, in 1912. The 1900 Sketch Book states that
            Parker's musical compositions were being printed by the Tribune
            Publishing Company of Jefferson City at the time of the Sketch
            Book's publication. Song titles included Rag Time Rastus, the
            Whistler, The Pickaninny's Lullaby, and Parker's most popular song,
            People Will Talk. Two stanzas of this song are published in the
            Sketch Book.
          </p>
          <p>
            To celebrate the successful end of fund-raising for the new First
            Baptist Church in 1925, Parker wrote six "victory campaign hymns" to
            the tunes of popular church hymns, which were published in the
            program folder for Victory Sunday, July 26, 1925. Parker was a
            strong supporter of the First Baptist Church, located on Capitol
            Avenue just three blocks from his home. He served as trustee,
            superintendent and teacher of the Sunday school, and a member of the
            church choir. Parker served on the board administrating Baptist
            state missions and Sunday schools, and served two terms as
            vice-president of the State B.Y.P.U.
          </p>
          <p>
            A portrait of Lester Shepard Parker and one of his own paintings are
            displayed in the church as reminders of his talent and dedication.
            The portrait was painted by Ralph Chesley Ott of St. Louis, who also
            had been engaged by the Capitol Decoration Committee to paint
            portraits of several Missouri governors. In 1926 Parker's portrait,
            an oil painting, was presented to the church to be hung over the
            fireplace in the Lester Parker Memorial Room which was redecorated
            by the Parker family following his death.
          </p>
          <p>
            The circa 1920s church, listed on the National Register of Historic
            Places, was demolished in the early 1980s to clear the site for a
            new sanctuary. This new building burned but was quickly replaced by
            the congregation, so the building standing today is the third
            sanctuary constructed since the death of Lester Parker. The portrait
            of Parker and his paintings escaped the fire because at some point
            they had been placed in storage, apparently under the supervision of
            Parker's friend Hugh Stephens. The disposition of the other
            paintings upon Stephens' death is undetermined.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the shoe factory, Parker had various other business
            interests including mining near Joplin, Missouri, a summer resort in
            South Haven, Michigan and growing cotton in the Missouri bootheel.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was president of the Economy Stay Company and the Capitol
            Telephone Company. Although Parker died before Capitol Telephone
            Company moved into its new building at 319 Madison Street in 1930,
            his investment in the company helped keep it afloat. According to
            one writer, Parker's acquisition of all minority shares of the
            Capitol Telephone Company was instrumental in the struggling firm's
            efforts to successfully compete against two rival telephone
            companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parker was well respected and successful, but he and his family seem
            to have had an abundance of misfortune. As a youth, the Parker
            family lived in Chicago next door to Mrs. O'Leary and her now famous
            cow and suffered the consequences, losing their home in the ensuing
            blaze. His first two wives died after only a few years of marriage.
            In 1882 he married Katie Lockard, mother of his daughter Gracie and
            son Dan. Katie died in November 1890 and another son, Clyde, died at
            the age of three. In May 1895 Parker married M. Sue O'Bannon,
            daughter of a former state legislator from Cass County. Sue had two
            children, Alice and Lester Parker, Jr. before she died in September
            1899.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parker married a third time in 1901. His third wife, with whom he
            shared the Parker House at 624 E. Capitol Avenue, was Missouri
            Gordon Parker, nicknamed "Zue." Lester Parker was active until his
            death in 1925 following surgery at Mayo Brothers Hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tragedy followed his wife Zue and daughter Rachel as well. Educated
            at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri and at Mount Holyoke
            College in Massachusetts, she became vice-president of the telephone
            company her husband had worked to establish. But in 1931, Zue and
            her only daughter, Rachel, were killed in a car crash near
            Independence, Missouri.

            Writer’s Ancillary Note on the Chicago fire of 1871: This from an
            internet site: http://www.mamalisa.com/?t=es&p=2353&c=23
          </p>
          <p>
            The story behind the song: “Mrs. Catherine O’Leary lived in Chicago,
            Illinois at the time of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. It was
            alleged that a fire started in her barn on the evening of October 8,
            1871 and then spread to the whole city. It turns out that Michael
            Ahern, a Chicago Daily Tribune reporter, made up the tale to have a
            colorful story to tell his newspaper.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution exonerating
            Mrs. O'Leary and her cow!”
          </p>
          <p>
            This does not mean to say there was no fire nor that it did not
            commence on her property and in her barn. It merely says the cow is
            relieved of being responsible for it and Mrs. O'Leary too; and there
            may or may not have been a lantern involved. The issue of how it
            started is simply not satisfied or addressed in the Council
            exoneration and, indeed, may never be known. Nonetheless, all
            theories—and there are a half dozen good ones—agree on the one fact
            that the fire started in the O'Leary's barn, exactly as the Parkers
            have said.
